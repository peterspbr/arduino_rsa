This implementation uses a simple integer encryption system using the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem. The main purpose of this is just to entertain myself, nothing more.

First i'm limited by the size of integer values, so i need to choose `p` and `q` as a very small prime number. The value of `n` can be factored in ms. Even the plaintext must be very small, about 5000.
